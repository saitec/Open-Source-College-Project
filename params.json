  "body": "### College Seminars\r\nEvery semester, multiple times, as an Indian engineering undergrad we have had to spend a lot of hours making reports, slides and seminars of often repetitive topics. This sort of teacher-pleasing, time-draining work is probably the thing that we could all live without. \r\n\r\n### Let's fix it?\r\nI plan on making my collective work freely accessible to anybody who wishes to use it. \r\n\r\n### What's in the whole thing?\r\n+ My entire archive of Seminars, Reports and resources used over 8 semesters. \r\n+ Research material that includes about 5000 odd published papers\r\n+ The rest is pretty self explanatory\r\n\r\n### Where can I access all of this? \r\nAccess all of that, and some more here: **[OSCP FILES](http://bit.ly/collegeHckz)**\r\n\r\n",
