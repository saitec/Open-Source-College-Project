  "body": "### College Seminars\r\nEvery semester, multiple times, as an Indian engineering undergrad we have had to spend a lot of hours making reports, slides and seminars of often repetitive topics. This sort of teacher-pleasing, time-draining work is probably the thing that we could all live without. \r\n\r\n### Let's fix it?\r\nI plan on making my collective work freely accessible to anybody who wishes to use it\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributorâ€™s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.",
